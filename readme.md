Stack used technologies: nativeJS + JQuery, PHP

This code from my online calculator, which was developed for my website.
oversize-calc.js gets data from form: height, mass, sex and send to backend;
handler-height.php gets data from frontend. Through sizes table, script php calculating suitable oversize and
send back to frontend where script js adding calculated result.

I'm used JQuery only because of AJAX. For update without page reload.
